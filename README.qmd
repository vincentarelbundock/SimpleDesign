# `SimpleDesign`

```{r}
#| include: false
options(SimpleDesign_print_style = "tinytable")
options(width = 150)
set.seed(48103)
```

A simple package to simulate and diagnose research designs:

* Simulate
* Fit
* Diagnose
  - Bias
  - RMSE
  - Power
  - Coverage

This is strongly influenced by the amazing `DeclareDesign` package.

Warning: This was just a quick Saturday morning project to see if I could roll my own simple solution. Nobody should use this for serious work.

### Installation

```r
remotes::install_github("vincentarelbundock/SimpleDesign")
```

### Usage

See the [`SimpleDesign tutorial for examples.`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/SimpleDesign/articles/tutorial.html)
